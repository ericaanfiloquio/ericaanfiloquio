## Hi, I'm Érica!🙋🏾‍♀️

I'm a Software Quality Assurance professional with a strong focus on continuous learning and process improvement.


🔧 My current QA Skills:

Manual testing: test case creation, execution, and refinement (Jira and TestRail)

Test automation using Cypress and Postman with JavaScript

API testing and scripting

Scrum Agile methodology

Basic HTML/CSS for better UI/UX understanding

Understanding of CI with Cypress and GitHub Actions

Quality-driven


🤓 Volunteer: I'm contributing as a QA volunteer in an Agile Simulation Project called Pipoca Ágil, collaborating with developers and POs to ensure software quality from planning to deployment.


🗺️ Curiosities: I have an adventurous soul: between 2022, 2023 and 2024, I backpacked around Europe, lived in Malta, and currently work remotely for a US-based company. 
I also had a small Virtual Assistance business where I provided Customer Service and Support to US-based companies.
